# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [v2.4.0] - 2025-06-15
### Changed
- Introduce two new plugin-specific constants, `AATXT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `AATXT_ENCRYPTION_SALT`, allowing API keys to be encrypted independently of WordPress’s own salts.
- Implement automatic migration of existing encrypted API keys: on upgrade, keys encrypted with the old WP salts are decrypted (if possible) and re-encrypted with the new plugin key.
- Add an optional info notice on the Auto Alt Text options page showing the ready-to-copy `define()` statements for `wp-config.php`.
- Maintain full backward-compatibility: if the new constants are not defined, the plugin continues to use the WordPress `LOGGED_IN_KEY`/`LOGGED_IN_SALT` fallback without interruption.

## [v2.3.4] - 2025-06-13
### Changed
- Displays an error message in the administration area if the WordPress salt keys were changed after the OpenAI API key was set. The message asks the user to enter the OpenAI API key again.
